# JackTrade
JackTrade is designed to help customers find service providers for any need. Created for Mobile Development Directed Study at Merrimack College.

JackTrade was created by 3 Computer Science students (Vikku Ponnaganti, Brian Boyle, and Kevin Sampson) at Merrimack College from January 2021 - May 2021.

The purpose of JackTrade is to connect people who need services provided by experts looking for work. Acting as a middleman, JackTrade will help you find
a plumber, electrician, tutor, or anybody in between.

JackTrade was developed for the iOS platform and as such, is written in SwiftUI with the backend hosted on Google Firebase.

The name JackTrade comes from the phrase "Jack of all Trades", although we hope our "Jack" isn't a "Master of None".
